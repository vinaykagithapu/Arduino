# Line Tracking Sensor
1. A line tracking sensor is a device used in robotics and automation to detect and follow lines or paths on the ground or a surface. 
2. These sensors are commonly employed in applications like line-following robots, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and conveyor systems. 
3. The primary function of a line tracking sensor is to provide feedback to the control system of the machine or robot, allowing it to adjust its direction and maintain alignment with a predefined path or line.

## Types of Line Tracking Sensors
1. **Infrared (IR) Line Sensors:** Infrared line tracking sensors typically consist of one or more infrared emitter and receiver pairs. The emitter emits infrared light, and the receiver detects the reflection of this light from the surface. The sensor can determine the position of a line or path by analyzing the intensity of the reflected light. When the sensor detects that the line is off-center, the control system can make adjustments to keep the robot or machine on track.

2. **Reflective Optical Sensors:** Reflective optical sensors use visible light sources (e.g., LEDs) and photodetectors to detect changes in light reflectivity from the surface. These sensors work by emitting light onto the surface and measuring the amount of light reflected back. When the sensor detects a change in reflectivity, such as transitioning from a dark line to a light background or vice versa, it triggers the control system to make necessary corrections.

Line tracking sensors are essential components in various automated systems designed for tasks like material handling, sorting, and navigation. They play a crucial role in ensuring precise and efficient movement along predefined paths or lines, making them valuable in industrial and educational robotics applications.
